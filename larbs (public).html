				#[[(hidden) ThXonBLoY]] the react vs angular principle, the debate of 
 having a forkable template vs creating a whole library to wrap around the tools you&#39;d have in the same template -- I just realized the same story applies with linux distros!!! [[arch (public)]] + [[larbs (public)]] - minimal, larbs is just minimal utilities/scripts + some default configs of programs e.g. i3, meanwhile e.g. manjaro &amp; others have a lot of stuff abstracted away, some even create wrapper programs that operate on top of existing ones

				the implications of this are big. one motivates the user to become smarter, to understand how the system works underneath, __and__ allows them to do it, all while not creating wrappers on top of existing programs, meaning that the knowledge you again is just as valuable outside the current setup
